# 🔥 Machine Overheat Detection System

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **real-time IoT-based monitoring system** designed to detect machine overheating and send instant alerts for safety and prevention of damage.  
It helps industries and workshops monitor machine health using low-cost sensors and microcontrollers.

---

## 💡 Objective
To build a smart, low-cost solution for detecting machine overheating and alerting users through **visual indicators**, **sound alarms**, and **SMS notifications**.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Hardware:** NodeMCU (ESP8266), DS18B20 Temperature Sensor, Buzzer, LED, GSM Module  
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Python, Blynk IoT Platform, Twilio API  
- **Languages:** C, Embedded C, Python  

---

## 🧠 Working Principle
1. The DS18B20 sensor continuously monitors the temperature of the machine.  
2. The NodeMCU processes the data and compares it against a safe threshold.  
3. If overheating is detected:
   - A **buzzer** and **LED** alert nearby users.  
   - An **SMS alert** is sent to the registered number using the GSM module.  
   - Data is updated to the **Blynk IoT dashboard** for remote monitoring.

## 🧩 Features
- Real-time temperature monitoring  
- Automatic local and remote alerts  
- Integration with IoT dashboard  
- Compact and affordable hardware setup  
- Ideal for small industries or academic projects
